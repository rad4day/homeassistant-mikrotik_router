### ISS-260326-tracker-wireless-detection — Device tracker uses old wireless detection logic
**Type:** Bug
**Priority:** Medium
**Created:** 2026-03-26
**Status:** 🔴 Closed — fixed in feature/v240-issues

**Context:**
`device_tracker.py` lines 157, 169, 199 check `source in ["capsman", "wireless"]` to determine wireless behavior (connection state, icon, attributes). The new `_is_wireless_host()` method in coordinator.py correctly detects wireless clients via bridge host table (fixing hAP ac2), but device_tracker still uses the old check.

**Impact:**
On routers with empty registration tables (hAP ac2 with new WiFi package), wireless clients discovered via bridge table have `source="arp"`, so the device tracker:
- Uses timeout-based `is_connected` instead of registration-based
- Shows wired icon instead of wireless
- Does not show wireless signal/rate attributes

**Fix:**
- Add `is_wireless` bool field to host data in coordinator (set by `_is_wireless_host`)
- Update device_tracker.py to check `self._data.get("is_wireless")` instead of source
